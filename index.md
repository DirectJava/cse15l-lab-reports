Before taking CSE 15L, students may need to take CSE 8A, then CSE 8B/11 in order to take this course. While taking this course, you also need to take CSE 12 alongside (if you are able to). If students are in CSE 15L, then we will be using Java as part of the programming language and VS code as a coding platform. In this tutorial, we will be guiding students on how to set up in order to work in CSE 15L.
