CSE 15L First Timers Tutorial (Windows)

Part I: Set Up VS Code (Skip this if you have VS Code Already)

  Step 1: Download java extension
  In order to set up VS Code, I had to download java first using this [link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) in order to have VS Code working functionally while coding

  By the time I reached this page, I selected Java 20, then clicked on the "x64 Installer to download the extension. I went ahead and downloaded the latest version in order to get the best experience possible while programming.
  
  *Caution: Since I find it complicated to set up my computer to acommodate Java and I don't remember much what I done, I am unable to discuss what I did here. 
  
  Step 3: Download the VS Code
  To download VS Code, I used this link https://code.visualstudio.com/Download. Then, I selected Windows because that's what I am currently using.

Part II: Download Git into VS Code and Connecting
  
  Step 1: Download Git
  Using this link: https://gitforwindows.org/, I was able to download git for my VS Code and on the link, I managed to download the latest version of GIT.

  Step 2: I headed down to VS Code and then I hit "Ctrl", "Shift", and "P" simultaneously. Then I typed in "Terminal: Select Default Profile", which should produce different terminal options. I also clicked Git Bash.

  For additional help, I followed this link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994
  

Part III: Testing the program
 
   Step 1: Logging in
   First, I copied and pasted (or typed) this in to the terminal: `ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu. Then, I replaced the zz with the 2 letters in the account (if I have one, if not, follow this link: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php to form my new CSE 15L password).

   Disclaimer: My account did not work witout the "-202" after the "ieng6" because the network system was not cooperating.
   
   Once I successfully logged in, this message displayed on my screen: The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 

I clicked yes in order to continue the work space as it will shown in Step 2.

   Step 2: Leading to the workspace
   In this step, my job is to test cases to see what outcomes can we get out of what we learned in the 1st 2 lectures. In order to do that, I tested by inputting commands shown in this photo:

   Here is another example:

   I tried other functions such as ls <directory> or other ls functions, which is supposed to show all the files I have on hand (and including the ones in the root folder). However, I was unable to get it work because I either did it wrong or I wasn't sure what the instructions were saying. 
  
   Disclaimer: This instructions may not be perfect. If you are still struggling with any steps, be sure to contact Professor Joe Politz (jpolitz@ucsd.edu) or reach out to the TAs.
