CSE 15L First Timers Tutorial

Before taking CSE 15L, students may need to take CSE 8A, then CSE 8B/11 in order to take this course. While taking this course, you also need to take CSE 12 alongside (if you are able to). If students are in CSE 15L, then we will be using Java as part of the programming language and VS code as a coding platform. In this tutorial, we will be guiding students on how to set up in order to work in CSE 15L.


Part I: Set Up VS Code

  Step 1: Download java extension
  In order to set up VS Code, students need to download java first in order to have VS Code working functionally while coding

  If students are on the mac, click on the mac tab to select files. For windows, it's the same thing, but instead click on the windows tab. It is recommended that students should download the latest version. In this case, use Java 20 and then click on "x64 Installer" (if on Windows) or "x64 DMG Installer" (if on Mac).
  
  Step 2: Download the VS Code
  To download VS Code, follow this link https://code.visualstudio.com/Download. Then click on Mac (if using Mac) or Windows (if using Windows).

Part II: Download Git into VS Code and Connecting
  
  Step 1: Download Git
  Using this link:..., students will be able to download the git for their VS Code and on the link, download the latest version of GIT.


  Step 2: Head down to VS Code and then hit "Ctrl", "Shift", and "P" simultaneously. Then type in "Terminal: Select Default Profile", which should produce different terminal options. Be sure to click Git Bash.

Part III: Testing the program
 
   Step 1: Logging in
   First, copy and paste (or type) this in to the terminal: ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu. Then, replace the zz with the 2 letters in the account (if you have one, if not, follow this link: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php to form your CSE 15L password).
   
   Step 2: Leading to the workspace
